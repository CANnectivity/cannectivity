  CANnectivity hardware configuration

  Example:
    cannectivity: cannectivity {
      compatible = "cannectivity";
      timestamp-counter = <&counter0>;

      channel {
        compatible = "cannectivity-channel";
        can-controller = <&can0>;
        termination-gpios = <&gpio0 6 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
        state-led = <&ch0_state_led>;
        activity-leds = <&ch0_activity_led>;
      };

      channel {
        compatible = "cannectivity-channel";
        can-controller = <&can1>;
        termination-gpios = <&gpio0 9 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
        state-led = <&ch1_state_led>;
        activity-leds = <&ch1_activity_led>;
      };
    };

compatible: "cannectivity"

include: base.yaml

properties:
  timestamp-counter:
    type: phandle
    description: |
      Phandle to 32-bit counter node running @ 1MHz. This counter is used for hardware timestamping
      of received and transmitted CAN frames. If not specified, hardware timestamping support will
      be disabled.

    CANnectivity CAN channel configuration. Channels are indexed in the order they appear in the
    final devicetree.

  compatible: "cannectivity-channel"

  properties:
    can-controller:
      type: phandle
      required: true
      description: |
        Phandle to the CAN controller node for this CAN channel.

    termination-gpios:
      type: phandle-array
      description: |
        GPIO to use to enable/disable the CAN channel termination resistor. This GPIO is driven
        active when the CAN termination is enabled and inactive when the CAN termination is
        disabled.

    state-led:
      type: phandle
      description: |
        Phandle for the CAN channel state LED.

    activity-leds:
      type: phandles
      description: |
        Phandle(s) for the CAN channel activity LED(s).

        If two LED phandles are specified, the LED phandle at index 0 will be used for indicating RX
        activity, and the LED phandle at index 1 will be used for indicating TX activity.
